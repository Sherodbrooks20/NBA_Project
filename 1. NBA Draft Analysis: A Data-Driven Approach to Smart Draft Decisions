__NBA DRAFT ANALYSIS: A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO SMART DRAFT DECISIONS__

__OBJECTIVE__:
This project focuses on evaluating NBA player statistics, both past and present, to identify patterns that align with long-term success. The ultimate goal is to help teams get more value out of their draft picks by recognizing not only top-tier talent but also uncovering overlooked players who go on to outperform expectations.

__DATA SOURCES & METHODOLOGY__:
I used a dataset from Kaggle that included player demographics and performance statistics.

__Data Cleaning & Preprocessing__: 
I cleaned and organized the data using Excel and SQL. This included removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting the dataset to prepare it for analysis.

__Key Analytical Approaches__

__Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)__: 
With Python and Pandas, I explored key trends across metrics like points, assists, rebounds, and efficiency. I broke these trends down by player position, draft range, and other categories to understand deeper performance patterns.

__Feature Selection & Performance Classification__: 
I standardized performance metrics using Z-scores to pinpoint outliers and classify players based on how they performed relative to expectations.
I grouped players into categories including Stars, Busts, Overperformers, and Underperformers. This helped highlight which players delivered more than expected and which ones underachieved based on where they were drafted.

__Comparative Analysis__: 
I compared player performance by draft range, analyzing lottery picks against mid and late first-round selections as well as second-round picks.
I also looked at performance by position to see how guards, wings, and bigs tend to differ statistically.
Additional analysis included evaluating the role of height and identifying which college programs tend to produce more successful NBA talent.

__Performance Classification Using Z-Scores__:

By applying Z-scores, I was able to create an objective way to evaluate how players performed in relation to their peers. Players with higher scores often emerged as unexpected standouts, while those with lower scores frequently failed to meet expectations.
This added a layer of statistical confidence when evaluating draft performance.

__Key Insights & Findings__:

Top Picks Usually Deliver, But Valuable Late Picks Exist
The analysis confirmed that top ten picks tend to have a strong impact in the league. However, some of the most successful players in recent history were drafted much later. This shows that smart scouting beyond the lottery can reveal high-potential talent.

Position-Based Performance Patterns
Guards often lead in assists, steals, usage rate, and shooting efficiency from the three-point line and free-throw line.
Wings tend to be the highest scorers and are usually well-rounded across different statistical categories.
Bigs dominate in rebounding, blocking, and efficiency metrics like field goal percentage, true shooting percentage, and player efficiency rating.

Z-Score-Based Player Categories
By comparing players to standardized expectations, I was able to clearly see which players were overachieving and which ones didn’t live up to the hype. This approach helped identify both hidden gems and overvalued picks.

__Practical Applications__:
This project provides a framework for teams, scouts, and analysts to approach player evaluation using real data.
Through Power BI dashboards, users can explore historical draft trends, compare draft classes, and analyze performance by position or pick number.
The insights from this analysis can help refine scouting strategies and reduce risk in the draft process.

__Next Steps & Future Enhancements__:
Moving forward, I plan to build on this project by introducing machine learning models to predict NBA success based on college statistics and scouting inputs.
I’d also like to bring in more advanced performance metrics, including offensive and defensive ratings, lineup-based analytics, and on/off-court splits.
Expanding the dataset to include international and G-League prospects will help provide a more complete view of the modern talent pool.

__Conclusion__:
This project set out to understand what makes an NBA player successful in the long run and how that ties back to where and how they were drafted.
Through statistical analysis, performance classification, and visual storytelling, I was able to highlight clear trends and give valuable insights.
Teams can use this framework to identify players with high upside, avoid common drafting pitfalls, and ultimately make better decisions that translate to long-term success on the court.
