NBA Draft Analysis: Identifying the Best Picks

Overview

This project analyzes NBA player performance to determine which prospects NBA teams should draft. Using historical data from Kaggle, Excel for preprocessing, Python (Pandas) for data analysis, and Power BI for visualization, we uncover key factors that predict NBA success.

Objective

The goal is to evaluate college and international player statistics to identify patterns that correlate with future NBA performance. This analysis helps teams make data-driven draft decisions.

Dataset

Source: Kaggle (NBA Draft Data)
Contents: Player college stats, NBA performance metrics (e.g., points, assists, efficiency ratings)
Preprocessing: Data cleaning and transformation in Excel and Pandas

Tools & Technologies

Excel: Data preprocessing and cleaning
Python (Pandas): Data analysis and feature engineering
Power BI: Interactive visualizations and dashboards

Analysis & Methodology

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution of key stats (PPG, APG, RPG)
Correlation between college stats and NBA performance
Identifying outliers and trends

Feature Selection:

Evaluating which college stats best predict NBA success
Comparing drafted vs. undrafted players

Data Visualization in Power BI:

Draft class performance comparison
College-to-NBA success rate by position
Interactive filters by team, position, and draft year

Key Findings

Players with high college efficiency ratings (PER) tend to have better NBA careers.
Assists and rebounding stats often predict long-term success, especially for guards.
Draft position does not always correlate with NBA successâ€”hidden gems can be found in later rounds.

How to Use This Project

Python Scripts: Run nba_analysis.py for data analysis.
Power BI Dashboard: Open nba_draft_dashboard.pbix to explore insights interactively.
Excel Data: Review cleaned_nba_data.xlsx for preprocessed datasets.

Next Steps

Apply machine learning models to predict player success.
Integrate additional scouting reports and player efficiency metrics.
