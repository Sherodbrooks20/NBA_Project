__NBA DRAFT ANALYSIS: DATA-DRIVEN DECISION-MAKING FOR SMARTER DRAFT PICKS__

__OBJECTIVE__:
The goal of this project is to evaluate past and present NBA player statistics to identify patterns that correlate with long-term success. By analyzing historical draft data, we can uncover insights that help teams maximize their draft selections, identifying not just top prospects but also hidden gems who outperform expectations.

__DATA SOURCES & METHODOLOGY__:
To conduct this analysis, I used a dataset from Kaggle containing NBA player demographic and performance metrics.

__Data Cleaning & Preprocessing__: 
Excel & SQL were used to structure and clean the data.

__Key Analytical Approaches__:

__Statistical Analysis & Modeling__: Python (Pandas) was used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection.
__Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)__: Understanding the distribution of key metrics like points per game (PPG), assists per game (APG), rebounds per game (RPG), and other key stats in relation to position, pick range, etc.
__Feature Selection & Performance Classification__: 
- Used Z-score standardization to classify players into:
- "Stars" (players who performed well above expectations)
- "Busts" (draft picks who significantly underperformed)
- "Overperformers" (players who exceeded expectations by draft position)
- "Underperformers" (players who didn’t meet their projected impact)
__Comparative Analysis__: 
- Pick Range Comparisons: Analyzed top 10, mid 1st round, late first round, and second round picks
- Position-Based Performance: Compared guards, wings, and bigs to identify key statistical trends.
- Height Analysis: Evaluated whether height plays a major role in NBA success.
- College Teams vs. NBA Performance: Measured which college programs produce the most successful NBA players.

__Performance Classification Using Z-Scores__:
- Standardized key statistics using Z-scores to categorize overperformers, underperformers, stars, and busts.
- Analyzed which players exceeded expectations in critical areas (e.g., scoring, assists, efficiency) and which failed to meet expectations relative to their draft position.
__Key Insights & Findings__:
TOP PICKS GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER IMPACT, BUT LATE-ROUND STEALS EXIST
- Z-score analysis confirmed that while top 10 picks are more likely to succeed, some of the biggest stars were selected outside the lottery.
- Teams should expand their scouting focus beyond the lottery to find undervalued talent.

POSITION-BASED PERFORMANCE TRENDS
- Each position group excels in different statistical categories, confirming role-based trends:

Guards:
- Best at assists (APG) and steals (SPG)
- Highest win shares (WS) and usage rate (USG%)
- Most efficient in three-point shooting (3P%) and free-throw percentage (FT%)

Wings (Forwards):
- Highest scoring averages (PPG)
- Balanced stat distribution across multiple categories

Bigs (Centers & Power Forwards):
- Dominate rebounding (RPG) and blocking (BPG)
- Highest field goal percentage (FG%) and true shooting percentage (TS%)
- Top performers in Player Efficiency Rating (PER)
- Z-SCORE REVEALED STARS & BUSTS BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPECTATIONS
- Players who significantly exceeded their draft expectations (high Z-scores).
- Players who underperformed relative to expectations (low Z-scores) include several lottery picks who failed to sustain high-level production.

__Practical Applications__:
This analysis provides teams, scouts, and analysts with a data-driven framework for evaluating NBA prospects.
Teams can use the Power BI dashboard to:
- Explore historical draft trends
- Compare draft classes and position-based performance
- Refine scouting strategies based on real statistical data
__Next Steps & Future Enhancements__:
To further enhance this project, I plan to:
- Apply machine learning models to predict player success using college statistics and advanced scouting reports.
- Incorporate advanced efficiency metrics, such as offensive rating, defensive impact scores, and lineup-based analytics.
- Expand the dataset to include international leagues and G-League pathways, providing a broader talent assessment.

__Conclusion__:
This project demonstrates how data analytics can revolutionize NBA draft decisions by identifying high-value prospects, uncovering hidden gems, and optimizing scouting strategies.

By leveraging Z-score analysis, historical trends, predictive modeling, and interactive visualizations, NBA teams and analysts can make smarter, more informed draft selections—leading to greater long-term success on the court.
